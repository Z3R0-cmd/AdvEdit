# AdvEdit

AdvEdit is the best online WEB-IDE out there. (Codepen does not count).

It has a live preview feature, and common keybindings. It used ACE. (The best web code editor base ever), Which means it is fast, Secure (Because all of your code is only loaded locally ever), and that makes it the best web-ide
